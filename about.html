        <h2>About Developer.</h2>
        <p> I'm a 19-year-old programmer from Chhattisgarh, currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and
            Engineering. I've been passionate about programming since I was 15, and I'm particularly drawn to
            competitive programming and data structures and algorithms. I'm currently an intermediate developer,
            actively working on personal projects and participating in hackathons. I'm always looking for new challenges
            and opportunities to improve my skills and learn from experienced developers. I'm eager to contribute to
            real-world projects, and I believe that Trackers is a great platform to showcase my abilities and gain
            valuable experience in building and maintaining a web application. I'm particularly interested in exploring areas like
            web development, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. I'm excited to be a part of this exciting field.
